# 🛠 K-Site Methods

K-Site  
**Folder Transformation Engine**  
→ Build once, deliver anywhere

---

This section walks through all four delivery modes —  
each built to turn your folder into a usable, zero-login website.

---

## 🔍 Available Modes

- **[ks-01-public](ks-01-public-viewer.html)**  
  → Turn any GitHub folder into a browsable site. No backend, no build.

- **[ks-02-private](ks-02-private-viewer.html)**  
  → Share a zipped folder. Open `index.html` → explore offline.

- **[ks-03-core](ks-03-core-viewer.html)**  
  → Desktop app. Drag any folder → get instant HTML viewer inside it.

- **[ks-04-zip](ks-04-zip-viewer.html)**  
  → Auto-generate a zipped HTML website from any folder.
