# K-Site â€“ Made By x_X

This system wasnâ€™t outsourced.  
It was designed, built, tested, and documented by one person â€”  
not as a portfolio, but as a functional response to real delivery gaps.

## Why K-Site Exists

Because zipped folders and email PDFs are lazy defaults.  
Because structured delivery is undervalued.  
Because too many demos ask for your login.  

K-Site solves this with no servers, no frameworks, no fluff.  
It turns any folder into a self-hosted, static site of viewer pages and folder indexes -  
readable by humans, crawlable by systems.

## What I Actually Did

- Designed the system logic (3 delivery modes + 1 portal site)  
- Built all engines: core viewer, zip-packager, dual desktop apps  
- Created GitHub CI workflows for cross-platform builds  
- Wrote all readme, method docs, and portal pages  
- Designed Google Analytics trace integration for public site
- Recorded and structured YouTube demos  
- Managed the entire packaging and deployment flow

## What It Represents

Not a product. Not a startup.  
A logic artifact. A signal. 

This is how I work:  
- I donâ€™t build shiny UIs. I build reuse.  
- I donâ€™t chase MVPs. I finish delivery systems.  
- I donâ€™t ship ideas. I ship structure.

This system was built to speak without permission.  
No marketing. No onboarding. No barriers.  
Just structure - from folder to signal.
