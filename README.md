# K-Site Portal - Folder Transformation Engine

K-Site is a folder transformation engine.  
It renders any structured folder into a static, zero-login website - with portable viewers, download-ready modes, and traceable pages (when hosted online).

-- No login  
-- No build system  
-- No dependencies

Just structure → site.  
-- You bring the folder --> K-Site brings the structure.

---

## Site Contents

<!-- auto-generated TOC will be inserted here by build_readme_toc.py -->
(Will list all files and folders as links, like Table of Content)

---

🛠️ Built with **K-Site** - a zero-GUI, automation-first static site generator.
