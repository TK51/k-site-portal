# K-Site Portal - Folder Transformation Engine

K-Site is a folder transformation engine.  
It renders any structured folder into a static, zero-login website - with portable viewers, download-ready modes, and traceable pages (when hosted online).

-- No login  
-- No build system  
-- No dependencies

Just structure → site.  
-- You bring the folder --> K-Site brings the structure.
