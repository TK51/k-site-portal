**[K-Site Portal Purpose]**  

This portal turns folders into structured websites.  
Designed for analysts, recruiters, and leads to browse tools, data, and logic — no install, no login.

# K-Site Portal – Folder Transformation Engine

**For recruiters:** this site shows how I structure, automate, and deliver working content systems - not demos, not slides - real outputs.  

**For hiring managers:** this isn’t theory. It’s how I build and ship structure under pressure - with traceable, live logic.  

**For non-tech users:** this is not a product. It’s a method. You upload a folder → it becomes a simple, clickable site - no login, no install, no noise.

**For technical readers:** want to see how it works? [Go under the hood →](https://tk51.github.io/k-site-portal/methods/ks-99-under-the-hood-viewer.html)

## What is this?

K-Site is a folder transformation engine.  
It renders any structured folder into a static, zero-login website - with portable viewers, download-ready modes, and traceable pages (when hosted online).

– No login  
– No build system  
– No dependencies

Just structure → site.  
You bring the folder → K-Site brings the structure.
